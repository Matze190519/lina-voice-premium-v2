## Design Philosophy
We need a design that screams "Future", "Premium", and "Efficiency". It must appeal to entrepreneurs who value time and results.

  **Design Movement**: **Cyberpunk Executive**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **High-Contrast Authority**: Deep, void-like blacks (#050505) contrasted with piercing neon cyan (#00F0FF) and electric purple (#BD00FF).
  2. **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Frosted glass elements with ultra-thin, glowing borders, simulating a high-tech HUD (Heads-Up Display).
  3. **Motion as Meaning**: Everything interacts. Buttons pulse like a heartbeat, cards tilt in 3D space on hover, text decodes itself into view.
  4. **Data Visualization**: Abstract data streams and waveforms in the background to symbolize AI processing power.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Void Black (#050505)**: Represents the infinite potential and stability of the backend.
  - **Neon Cyan (#00F0FF)**: Represents intelligence, speed, and the "voice" of Lina.
  - **Electric Purple (#BD00FF)**: Represents creativity and the "magic" of AI.
  - **White (#FFFFFF)**: Used sparingly for absolute clarity in text.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Asymmetric Fluidity**. Break the grid. Use large, floating typography that overlaps with 3D elements. Sections flow into each other with diagonal cuts or organic waves, not hard horizontal lines.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **The "Core"**: A central, pulsing orb or waveform visualization that reacts to the user's scroll, representing Lina's "heartbeat".
  2. **Holographic Cards**: Feature cards that look like floating holographic projections.
  3. **Glitch Accents**: Subtle, controlled glitch effects on hover states to emphasize the digital nature.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Direct Manipulation**. The user feels like they are operating a futuristic console. Hover effects are instant and snappy. Scrolling feels like moving through a data tunnel.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide in with a "snap" and a subtle chromatic aberration effect.
  - **Scroll**: Parallax effects where background elements move at different speeds than foreground content.
  - **Micro**: Buttons glow intensely when clicked.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Orbitron** or **Rajdhani** (Tech/Futuristic) - Bold, uppercase, wide tracking.
  - **Body**: **Exo 2** or **Barlow** (Clean/Readable) - High legibility, modern geometric feel.

  **Design Movement**: **Neo-Brutalism Tech**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Functionality**: Exposed structural elements, visible grids, and monospaced typography.
  2. **Bold & Unapologetic**: High contrast, large solid shadows, thick borders.
  3. **Information Density**: Presenting data (pricing, specs) in a raw, unfiltered way, appealing to the analytical mind of an entrepreneur.
  4. **Retro-Future**: A nod to the early internet but with modern performance and smoothness.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Off-White (#F0F0F0)**: A stark, clean canvas.
  - **Deep Blue (#0000FF)**: The classic "link" color, reimagined as a primary brand color.
  - **Acid Green (#CCFF00)**: For high-impact CTAs and success metrics.
  - **Black (#000000)**: For structure, borders, and text.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Modular Grid**. Everything is in a box. Borders are thick and visible. The layout is rigid but flexible, like a dashboard.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text banners for announcements and USPs.
  2. **Hard Shadows**: Buttons and cards have solid black drop shadows (no blur).
  3. **Terminal Windows**: Code snippets or chat logs presented in stylized terminal windows.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Tactile Feedback**. Buttons depress visually. Toggles click. The interface feels mechanical.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements slide up from behind masks.
  - **Scroll**: Sticky headers and sidebars that lock into place.
  - **Micro**: Hover states invert colors (black on white -> white on black).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Space Grotesk** - Quirky but authoritative sans-serif.
  - **Body**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Roboto Mono** - Technical, precise, code-like.

  **Design Movement**: **Ethereal Minimalism**
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Focus & Clarity**: Removing all non-essential elements. The content is the hero.
  2. **Soft Light**: Using gradients and blurs to create a sense of depth and atmosphere without hard lines.
  3. **Human-Centric AI**: Emphasizing the "natural" and "helpful" aspect of Lina, rather than the "robotic" side.
  4. **Fluidity**: Everything feels like it's floating in a zero-gravity environment.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Midnight (#0B0C15)**: A soft, warm black.
  - **Aurora Gradients**: Blends of soft pink, peach, and violet (#FF9A9E to #FECFEF).
  - **Starlight White (#FDFDFD)**: For text and primary elements.

  **Layout Paradigm**: **Central Axis**. Content flows down a central line, branching out organically. Lots of negative space.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Glowing Orbs**: Soft, blurred circles of color moving slowly in the background.
  2. **Glass Cards**: Highly transparent cards with strong background blur (backdrop-filter).
  3. **Fine Lines**: Ultra-thin (1px) lines connecting elements, symbolizing neural networks.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: **Gentle Guidance**. Hover effects are slow and smooth (ease-out). No sudden movements.

  **Animation**:
  - **Entrance**: Elements fade in and float up slowly.
  - **Scroll**: Smooth scrolling with heavy damping.
  - **Micro**: Subtle glow intensification on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: **Outfit** or **Plus Jakarta Sans** - Friendly, geometric, modern.
  - **Body**: **Inter** (customized weights) - Invisible, purely functional.

## Selected Approach: **Cyberpunk Executive**

**Reasoning**:
The user wants "futuristic", "wow effect", "not standard", and "selling the future". The **Cyberpunk Executive** style fits this perfectly. It combines the high-tech feel of AI (Cyberpunk) with the seriousness required for B2B sales (Executive). It allows for the "wow" effects (particles, glowing elements, 3D tilts) while maintaining a dark, premium look that aligns with the existing branding but elevates it significantly.

**Key Features to Implement**:
1. **Hero**: A massive, interactive 3D waveform or particle sphere representing Lina's voice core.
2. **Comparison Table**: A "Head-to-Head" battle card style, glowing green for Lina, red for others.
3. **Pricing**: Holographic cards that look like they are floating.
4. **Call Button**: A pulsing, "reactor core" style button that demands to be clicked.
5. **Video Section**: Framed like a futuristic monitor or HUD.

**Typography**:
- **Headings**: `Orbitron` (for that sci-fi header feel)
- **Body**: `Rajdhani` (technical but readable) or `Exo 2`.

**Colors**:
- Background: `#050505` (Deep Black)
- Primary Accent: `#00F0FF` (Cyan - Intelligence/Voice)
- Secondary Accent: `#BD00FF` (Purple - AI/Magic)
- Text: `#FFFFFF` (White) & `#E0E0E0` (Light Gray)
